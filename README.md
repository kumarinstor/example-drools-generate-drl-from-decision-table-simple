# Drools - Generate DRL from Decision Tables

When authoring Decision Tables, it is helpful to see the drl rules being generated.  This simple example demonstrates the generation of a DRL from a decision table.

* [SimpleGenerateDrlFileFromDecisionTable.java]() contains the example code for generating the DRL.
* For large projects with many decision tables, the code can be enhanced to generate DRL for all decision tables present in the rule folder structure.
