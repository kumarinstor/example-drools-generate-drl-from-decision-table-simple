# Drools - Generate DRL from Decision Tables

When authoring Decision Tables, it is helpful to see the drl rules being generated.  This simple example demonstrates the generation of a DRL from a decision table.

* [SimpleGenerateDrlFileFromDecisionTable.java](https://github.com/David1858/example-drools-generate-drl-from-decision-table-simple/blob/master/src/test/java/org/example/model/SimpleGenerateDrlFileFromDecisionTable.java) contains the example code for generating the DRL.
* For large projects with many decision tables, the code can be enhanced to generate DRL for all decision tables present in the rule folder structure.
